\title{Play one complete Monty Hall game}
\usage{
play_game()
}
\value{
A data frame with two rows and two columns:
- 'strategy': a character vector with values "stay" and "switch"
- 'outcome': a character vector with the corresponding game outcomes ("WIN" or "LOSE")
}
\description{
`play_game()` simulates one complete game of the Monty Hall problem,
including both stay and switch strategies.
}
\details{
This function orchestrates a complete play-through of the Monty Hall Problem.
It creates a new game setup, simulates the contestant's initial door selection,
the host opening a goat door, and then determines the outcome for both strategies:
staying with the initial selection and switching to the other unopened door.
This allows for a direct comparison of the two strategies in a single game instance.
