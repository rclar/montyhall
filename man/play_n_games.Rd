\title{Play multiple Monty Hall games}
\usage{
play_n_games(n = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer specifying the number of games to simulate. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the results of all simulated games. Each row represents
one game strategy (stay or switch) for one simulation. The function also prints
a table showing the proportion of wins for each strategy.
}
\description{
`play_n_games()` simulates multiple games of the Monty Hall problem
and returns the aggregate results.
}
\details{
This function runs a specified number of Monty Hall game simulations,
collects the results, and provides a summary of the outcomes for both
the stay and switch strategies. It's useful for demonstrating the long-term
probabilities of winning with each strategy.
}
\examples{
# Run 1000 game simulations
results <- play_n_games(1000)

# View the first few results
head(results)

# Calculate overall win percentages
table(results$strategy, results$outcome) / nrow(results) * 100

}
